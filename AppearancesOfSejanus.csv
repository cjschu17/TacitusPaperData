Passage,Summary,Commentary
1.24,"Sejanus is described as a man magna apud Tiberium auctoritate. A director for Drusus as he tries to put down the revolt of the Percennians. He is also described as the one to demonstrate to the praetorian guards 'the advantages of obedience and disadvantages of disobedience' - from Miller 146.",
1.69,"In Germanicus' fight against the Germans, Tacitus digresses and talks about the actions of Agrippina, mother of Caligula. Agrippina is hateful to Tiberius since he sees her benevolent actions as a way to improve her own station and get favor for her son in the future. Tacitus writes accendebat haec onerabatque Seianus, peritia morum Tiberii odia in longum iaciens, quae reconderet auctaque promeret. Sejanus was incednign and aggravating these thoughts and casting hatred into the futre becasue of his skill with the custom of Tiberius, hatreds which he could store and put forth when grown",first real insight into the nefarious nature of Sejanus. Reconderet also used earlier to decribe how Tiberius was twisting faces into crimes at I.8
