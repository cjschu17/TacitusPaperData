Passage,Summary,Commentary
1.24,"Sejanus is described as a man magna apud Tiberium auctoritate. A director for Drusus as he tries to put down the revolt of the Percennians. He is also described as the one to demonstrate to the praetorian guards 'the advantages of obedience and disadvantages of disobedience' - from Miller 146.",
1.69,"In Germanicus' fight against the Germans, Tacitus digresses and talks about the actions of Agrippina, mother of Caligula. Agrippina is hateful to Tiberius since he sees her benevolent actions as a way to improve her own station and get favor for her son in the future. Tacitus writes accendebat haec onerabatque Seianus, peritia morum Tiberii odia in longum iaciens, quae reconderet auctaque promeret. Sejanus was incednign and aggravating these thoughts and casting hatred into the futre becasue of his skill with the custom of Tiberius, hatreds which he could store and put forth when grown",first real insight into the nefarious nature of Sejanus. Reconderet also used earlier to decribe how Tiberius was twisting faces into crimes at I.8
3.16,"In the wake of Germanicus' death, Piso was accused of poisoning him. He later commits suicide. Tacitus relates the he heard from his elders that Piso used to carry a around a documetn accusing Tiberius of the crime but he was persuaded not to do so by the empty promises of Sejanus (ni elusus a Seiano per vana promissa foret;) though Tacitus later admits that he does not believe this si true",Again the nefarious nature of Sejanus comes to the fore
3.29,"Tiberius made Sejanus the father-in-law to Claudius' son thereby becoming part of the family. This news the people accepted with adverse spirits (adversis animis). To the people it seemed that Sejanus was polluting the nobility of the family and his hopes of ruling which were already suspected were becoming true (polluisse nobilitatem familiae videbatur suspectumque iam nimiae spei Seianum ultra extulisse)",first real connection to Juvenal as the idea of being born up too high
3.35,"when choosing the procnsular for Africa, Blaesus, uncle to Sejanus is chosen. Tacitus says that this relationship was not discussed but was understood and ebcause of the relationship he was powerful",the hidden power of Sejanous
3.66,"Sejanus is said to aid a man of ill-repute and an unknown beginning become a senator by the power of Sejanus (potentia Sejanus)",
3.72,"I think this is jsut saying that Sejanus had something to do with preserving the theater of Pompey from the fire and because of this he was praised by Tiberius. He was also praised on behalf of his uncle's success in Africa,
